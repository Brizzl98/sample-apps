Health   Conditions Causes of High Triglycerides Author Alot Health Team Share Tweet Pin Triglyceride  TG  triacylglycerol TAG  or triacylglyceride  is a type of fat  or lipid  found in the blood that the body stores up to use for energy  One needs some triglycerides for good health  but high triglycerides can increase the risk of heart disease  diabetes  and stroke  It may also be a sign of metabolic syndrome  which is the combination of high blood pressure  high blood sugar  too much fat around the waist  and high triglycerides  A healthy triglyceride level is 150 or under  Borderline high is 150 199  High is 200 499  And very high is 500 and up  Triglycerides are the main ingredient in both vegetable oil and animal fat  so one way to maintain a healthy triglyceride count is to reduce the amount of fried foods and red meat one eats  Alcohol also greatly affects triglycerides  To lower levels  one should consume no more than one or two drinks daily  or for those with higher counts  it may be recommended that alcohol is cut completely from the diet  Triglycerides are measured using a common test called a lipid panel  The American Heart Association recommends that everyone over the age of 20 have their triglyceride level tested  Error setting up player  Invalid license key Details of High Triglyceride Causes High triglyceride causes include a number of factors  some of which are controllable  A high triglyceride count is usually caused by obesity  poorly controlled diabetes  an underactive thyroid  kidney disease  unhealthy diet  eating more calories than are burned   and drinking a lot of alcohol  Each of these causes can increase triglyceride levels  and consequently  any combination raises levels exponentially  There are certain medications that may raise triglycerides  including Tamoxifen  used to treat breast cancer   steroids  beta blockers  diuretics  estrogen  and birth control pills  Inheriting high triglycerides is possible but rare  and it is usually the diet and lifestyle that is inherited  not the condition  Lack of exercise and physical activity raises levels as less and less stored calories are used  building up fat stores and the triglycerides stored in that fat  Drinking more than one alcoholic beverage per day for women  and more than two for men  causes a high triglyceride count  Eating heavily processed foods high in saturated fat  trans fat  such as fried and commercially baked products  and red meat  will cause high triglyceride levels  Sugary and refined foods containing simple carbohydrates  sugar  white flour   increase triglycerides  Risk Factors of High Triglyceride High triglyceride treatment can address and improve many of the related conditions and causes including overall health  fitness  cholesterol levels  and heart health  Maintaining a high triglyceride count  consequently  can cause many high triglyceride risk factors  Researchers have believed for some time that elevated triglycerides are an indication of increased risk for coronary heart disease  CHD   Recent research shows that high triglyceride levels are themselves an independent risk factor  Triglycerides continue to take a more central position in heart health concerns  Child obesity continues on a sharp incline  which is leading to the early onset of such diseases as atherosclerosis and diabetes  Individuals with kidney disease  liver disease  and familial hypertriglyceridemia are medical conditions  not lifestyle choices  that increase risk of having dangerously high triglyceride levels and heart problems  Finally  the trend toward high levels of processing in the food industry  combined with poor diets and low amounts of physical activity  all contribute greatly to the risk factors of high triglycerides  This is also contributing to the world type 2 diabetes pandemic  Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes may result in an increased frequency and severity of infections and risk of developing pulmonary tuberculosis  Read these next Treatment for Triglycerides What are Triglycerides  High Blood Sugar Symptoms", "tokens": {"values": [5320, 1997, 2152, 13012, 25643, 17119, 8621, 23067, 2102, 2740,

best to check with the place you are dropping them off  each lab is different in terms of what they will accept and im sure each country would also be different  so check with them just to be suremum

my DD  We were told to store them in the frigde and also that they had to be collected within a 24hr period so not sure if its the same for you guys  Also remember that they cant be contaminated so dr suggested lining DD nappy with cling wrap and collect it off that  she s in nappy  or if your kids are older to use an old container  Good luck this stuff is never fun nor is the cost in this matter

For other uses  see Plastic  disambiguation    Age of Plastics   redirects here  For the album by The Buggles  see The Age of Plastic  Household items made of various types of plastic IUPAC definition of  plastic  Generic term used in the case of polymeric material that may contain other substances to improve performance or reduce costs  Note 1  The use of this term instead of polymer is a source of confusion and thus is not recommended  Note 2  This term is used in polymer engineering for materials often compounded that can be processed by flow    1 Plastic is material consisting of any of a wide range of synthetic or semi synthetic organic compounds that are malleable and so can be molded into solid objects  Plasticity is the general property of all materials which can deform irreversibly without breaking but  in the class of moldable polymers  this occurs to such a degree that their actual name derives from this specific ability  Plastics are typically organic polymers of high molecular mass and often contain other substances  They are usually synthetic  most commonly derived from petrochemicals  however  an array of variants are made from renewable materials such as polylactic acid from corn or cellulosics from cotton linters    2 Due to their low cost  ease of manufacture  versatility  and imperviousness to water  plastics are used in a multitude of products of different scale  including paper clips and spacecraft  They have prevailed over traditional materials  such as wood  stone  horn and bone  leather  metal  glass  and ceramic  in some products previously left to natural materials  In developed economies  about a third of plastic is used in packaging and roughly the same in buildings in applications such as piping  plumbing or vinyl siding

packaging    3 Plastics have many uses in the medical field as well  with the introduction of polymer implants and other medical devices derived at least partially from plastic  The field of plastic surgery is not named for use of plastic materials  but rather the meaning of the word plasticity  with regard to the reshaping of flesh  The world s first fully synthetic plastic was bakelite  invented in New York in 1907 by Leo Baekeland   4  who coined the term  plastics     5  Many chemists have contributed to the materials science of plastics  including Nobel laureate Hermann Staudinger who has been called   the father of polymer chemistry    and Herman Mark  known as   the father of polymer physics       6 The success and dominance of plastics starting in the early 20th century led to environmental concerns regarding its slow decomposition rate after being discarded as trash due to its composition of large molecules  Toward the end of the century  one approach to this problem was met with wide efforts toward recycling  Contents1 Etymology2 Structure3 Properties and classifications3 1 Thermoplastics and thermosetting polymers3 2 Amorphous plastics and crystalline plastics3

links Etymology The word plastic derives from the Greek \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2   plastikos  meaning   capable of being shaped or molded   and  in turn  from \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2   plastos  meaning   molded      7    8 The plasticity  or malleability  of the material during manufacture allows it to be cast  pressed  or extruded into a variety of shapes  such as  films  fibers  plates  tubes  bottles  boxes  amongst many others  The common noun plastic should not be confused with the technical adjective plastic  The adjective is applicable to any material which undergoes a plastic deformation  or permanent change of shape  when strained beyond a certain point  For example  aluminum which is stamped or forged exhibits plasticity in this sense  but is not plastic in the common sense  By contrast  some plastics will  in their finished forms  break before deforming and therefore are not plastic in the technical sense  Structure Most plastics contain organic polymers    9  The vast majority of these polymers are formed from chains of carbon atoms   pure  or with the addition of  oxygen  nitrogen  or sulfur  The chains comprise many repeat units  formed from monomers  Each polymer chain will have several thousand repeating units  The backbone is the part of the chain that is on the   main path    linking together a large number of repeat units  To customize the properties of a plastic  different molecular groups   hang   from this backbone  These pendant units are usually   hung   on the monomers  before the monomers themselves are linked together to form the polymer chain  It is the structure of these side chains that influences the properties of the polymer  The molecular structure of the repeating unit can be fine tuned to influence specific properties in the polymer  Properties and classifications Plastics are usually classified by  the chemical structure of the polymer s backbone and side chains  some important groups in these classifications are  the acrylics  polyesters  silicones  polyurethanes  and halogenated plastics  Plastics can also be classified by  the chemical process used in their synthesis  such as  condensation  polyaddition  and cross linking    10 Plastics can also be classified by  their various physical properties  such as  hardness  density  tensile strength  resistance to heat and glass transition temperature  and by their chemical properties  such as the organic chemistry of the polymer and its resistance and reaction to various chemical products and processes  such as  organic solvents  oxidation  and ionizing radiation  In particular  most plastics will melt upon heating to a few hundred degrees celsius    11 Other classifications are based on qualities that are relevant for manufacturing or product design  Examples of such qualities and classes are  thermoplastics and thermosets  conductive polymers  biodegradable plastics and engineering plastics and other plastics with particular structures  such as elastomers  Thermoplastics and thermosetting polymers The plastic handle of a spatula that has been deformed by heat  One important classification of plastics is by the permanence or impermanence of their form  or whether they are  thermoplastics or thermosetting polymers  Thermoplastics are the plastics that  when heated  do not undergo chemical change in their composition and so can be molded again and again  Examples include  polyethylene   PE   polypropylene   PP   polystyrene   PS  and polyvinyl chloride   PVC     12  Common thermoplastics range from 20 000 to 500 000 amu  while thermosets are assumed to have infinite molecular weight  Thermosets  or thermosetting polymers  can melt and take shape only once  after they have solidified  they stay solid    13  In the thermosetting process  a chemical reaction occurs that is irreversible  The vulcanization of rubber is an example of a thermosetting process  before heating with sulfur  the polyisoprene is a tacky  slightly runny material  after vulcanization  the product is rigid and non tacky  Amorphous plastics and crystalline plastics Many plastics are completely amorphous    14  such as  all thermosets  polystyrene and its copolymers  and poly methyl methacrylate  However  some plastics are partially crystalline and partially amorphous in molecular structure  giving them both a melting point  the temperature at which the attractive intermolecular forces are overcome  and also one or more glass transitions  the temperatures above which the extent of localized molecular flexibility is substantially increased  These so called semi crystalline plastics include  polyethylene  polypropylene  poly vinyl chloride  polyamides  nylons   polyesters and some polyurethanes  Conductive polymers Intrinsically Conducting Polymers   ICP  are organic polymers that conduct electricity  While plastics can be made electrically conductive  with a conductivity of up to 80 k S cm in stretch oriented polyacetylene    15  they are still no match for most metals like copper which have a conductivity of several hundred k S cm  Nevertheless  this is a developing field  Biodegradable plastics and bioplastics Main article  Biodegradable plastic Biodegradable plastics are plastics that degrade  or break down  upon exposure to  sunlight or ultra violet radiation  water or dampness  bacteria  enzymes or wind abrasion  In some instances  rodent  pest  or insect attack can also be considered as forms of biodegradation or environmental degradation  Some modes of degradation require that the plastic be exposed at the surface   aerobic    whereas other modes will only be effective if certain conditions exist in landfill or composting systems   anaerobic    Some companies produce biodegradable additives  to enhance biodegradation  Plastic can have starch powder added as a filler to allow it to degrade more easily  but this still does not lead to the complete breaking down of the plastic  Some researchers have genetically engineered bacteria to synthesize completely biodegradable plastics  such as Biopol  however  these are expensive at present    16 Bioplastics Main article  Bioplastic While most plastics are produced from petrochemicals  bioplastics are made substantially from renewable plant materials such  as cellulose and starch    17  Due both to the finite limits of the petrochemical reserves and to the threat of global warming  the development of bioplastics is a growing field  However  bioplastic development begins from a very low base and  as yet  does not compare significantly with petrochemical production  Estimates of the global production capacity for bio derived materials is put at 327 000 tonnes year  In contrast  global production of polyethylene  PE  and polypropylene  PP   the world s leading petrochemical derived polyolefins  was estimated at over 150 million tonnes in 2015

Made in England  c   1950The development of plastics has evolved from the use of natural plastic materials  e g   chewing gum  shellac  to the use of chemically modified  natural materials  e g   natural rubber  nitrocellulose  collagen  galalite  and finally to completely synthetic molecules  e g   bakelite  epoxy  polyvinyl chloride    Early plastics were bio derived materials such as egg and blood proteins  which are organic polymers  In 1600 BC  Mesoamericans used natural rubber for balls  bands  and figurines    3  Treated cattle horns were used as windows for lanterns in the Middle Ages  Materials that mimicked the properties of horns were developed by treating milk proteins   casein  with lye  In the 1800s  as industrial chemistry developed during the Industrial Revolution  many materials were reported  The development of plastics also accelerated with Charles Goodyear  s discovery of vulcanization to thermoset materials derived from natural rubber  Blue plaque commemorating Parkes on the Birmingham Science Museum  Parkesine    nitrocellulose  is considered the first man made plastic  The plastic material was patented by Alexander Parkes  in Birmingham  England in 1856    19  It was unveiled at the 1862 Great International Exhibition in London    20  Parkesine won a bronze medal at the 1862 World s fair in London  Parkesine was made from cellulose   the major component of plant cell walls  treated with nitric acid as a solvent  The output of the process  commonly known as cellulose nitrate or pyroxilin  could be dissolved in alcohol and hardened into a transparent and elastic material that could be molded when heated    21  By incorporating pigments into the product  it could be made to resemble ivory  In 1897  the Hanover  Germany mass printing press owner Wilhelm Krische was commissioned to develop an alternative to blackboards    22  The resultant horn like plastic made from the milk protein casein was developed in cooperation with the Austrian chemist  Friedrich  Adolph Spitteler  1846 1940   The final result was unsuitable for the original purpose    23  In 1893  French chemist Auguste Trillat discovered the means to insolubilize casein by immersion in formaldehyde  producing material marketed as galalith    22 In the early 1900s  Bakelite  the first fully synthetic thermoset  was reported by Belgian chemist Leo Baekeland by using phenol and formaldehyde  After World War I  improvements in chemical technology led to an explosion in new forms of plastics  with mass production beginning in the 1940s and 1950s  around World War II      24  Among the earliest examples in the wave of new polymers were polystyrene   PS   first produced by BASF in the 1930s    3  and polyvinyl chloride   PVC   first created in 1872 but commercially produced in the late 1920s    3  In 1923  Durite Plastics Inc  was the first manufacturer of phenol furfural resins    25  In 1933  polyethylene was discovered by Imperial Chemical Industries   ICI  researchers Reginald Gibson and Eric Fawcett    3 In 1954  polypropylene was discovered by Giulio Natta and began to be manufactured in 1957    3 In 1954  expanded polystyrene  used for building insulation  packaging  and cups  was invented by Dow Chemical    3 Polyethylene terephthalate   PET  s discovery is credited to employees of the Calico Printers  Association in the UK in 1941  it was licensed to Du Pont for the USA and ICI otherwise  and as one of the few plastics appropriate as a replacement for glass in many circumstances  resulting in widespread use for bottles in Europe    3 Plastics industry Main articles  Chemical industry and Plastics industry Plastics manufacturing is a major part of the chemical industry  and some of the world s largest chemical companies have been involved since the earliest days  such as the industry leaders BASF and Dow Chemical  In 2014  sales of the top fifty companies amounted to US  961 300 000 000    26  The firms came from some eighteen countries in total  with more than half of the companies on the list being headquartered in the US  Many of the top fifty plastics companies were concentrated in just three countries United States   12Japan   8Germany   6BASF was the world s largest chemical producer for the ninth year in a row    26 Trade associations which represent the industry in the US include the American Chemistry Council  Industry standards Many of the properties of plastics are determined by standards specified by ISO  such as ISO 306   Thermoplastics Many of the properties of plastics are determined by the UL Standards  tests specified by Underwriters Laboratories   UL   such as Flammability   UL94High voltage arc tracking rate   UL746AComparative Tracking Index Additives Blended into most plastics are additional organic or inorganic compounds   The average content of additives is a few percent  Many of the controversies associated with plastics actually relate to the additives    27  organotin compounds are particularly toxic    28 Typical additives include Stabilizers Stabilizers prolong the lifetime of the polymer by suppressing degradation that results from UV light  oxidation  and other phenomena  Typical stabilzers thus absorb UV light or function as antioxidants  Fillers Many plastics    citation needed  contain fillers  to improve performance or reduce production costs    29  Typically fillers are mineral in origin  e g   chalk  Other fillers include  starch  cellulose  wood flour  ivory dust and zinc oxide most fillers are relatively inert and inexpensive materials  make the product cheaper by weight stabilizing additives include fire retardants  to lower the flammability of the material some fillers are more chemically active and are called  reinforcing agents    30 Plasticizers Plasticizers are  by mass  often the most abundant additives    28  These oily but nonvolatile compounds are blended in to plastics to improve rheology  as many organic polymers are otherwise too rigid for particular applications  Dioctyl phthalate is the most common plasticizer  Colorants Colorants are another common additive  though their weight contribution is small  Toxicity Pure plastics have low toxicity due to their insolubility in water and because they are biochemically inert  due to a large molecular weight  Plastic products contain a variety of additives  some of which can be toxic  For example  plasticizers like adipates and phthalates are often added to brittle plastics like polyvinyl chloride to make them pliable enough for use in food packaging  toys  and many other items  Traces of these compounds can leach out of the product  Owing to concerns over the effects of such leachates  the European Union has restricted the use of DEHP   di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate  and other phthalates in some applications  and the United States has limited the use of DEHP  DPB  BBP  DINP  DIDP  and Dn OP in children s toys and child care articles with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act  Some compounds leaching from polystyrene food containers have been proposed to interfere with hormone functions and are suspected human carcinogens    31  Other chemicals of potential concern include alkylphenols    28 Whereas the finished plastic may be non toxic  the monomers used in the manufacture of the parent polymers may be toxic  In some cases  small amounts of those chemicals can remain trapped in the product unless suitable processing is employed  For example  the World Health Organization  s International Agency for Research on Cancer   IARC  has recognized vinyl chloride  the precursor to PVC  as a human carcinogen    31 Bisphenol A  BPA Some polymers may also decompose into the monomers or other toxic substances when heated  In 2011  it was reported that   almost all plastic products   sampled released chemicals with estrogenic activity  although the researchers identified plastics which did not leach chemicals with estrogenic activity    32 The primary building block of polycarbonates  bisphenol A   BPA   is an estrogen  like endocrine disruptor that may leach into food    31  Research in Environmental Health Perspectives finds that BPA leached from the lining of tin cans  dental sealants and polycarbonate bottles can increase body weight of lab animals  offspring    33  A more recent animal study suggests that even low level exposure to BPA results in insulin resistance  which can lead to inflammation and heart disease    34 As of January 2010  the LA Times newspaper reports that the United States FDA is spending  30 million to investigate indications of BPA being linked to cancer    35 Bis  2 ethylhexyl  adipate  present in plastic wrap based on PVC  is also of concern  as are the volatile organic compounds present in new car smell  The European Union has a permanent ban on the use of phthalates in toys  In 2009  the United States government banned certain types of phthalates commonly used in plastic    36 Environmental effects See also  Plastic pollution  Marine debris  and Great Pacific Garbage Patch Most plastics are durable and degrade very slowly  as their chemical structure renders them resistant to many natural processes of degradation  However  microbial species capable of degrading plastics are known to science  and some are potentially useful for the disposal of certain classes of plastic waste  In 1975 a team of Japanese scientists studying ponds containing waste water from a nylon factory  discovered a strain of Flavobacterium that digested certain byproducts of nylon 6 manufacture  such as the linear dimer of 6 aminohexanoate    37  Nylon 4 or polybutyrolactam can be degraded by the  ND 10 and ND 11  strands of Pseudomonas sp  found in sludge  This produced \u03b3 aminobutyric acid  GABA  as a byproduct    38 Several species of soil fungi can consume polyurethane    39  This includes two species of the Ecuadorian fungus Pestalotiopsis that can consume polyurethane aerobically and also in anaerobic conditions such as those at the bottom of landfills    40 Methanogenic consortia degrade styrene  using it as a carbon source    41  Pseudomonas putida can convert styrene oil into various biodegradable polyhydroxyalkanoates    42    43 Microbial communities isolated from soil samples mixed with starch have been shown to be capable of degrading polypropylene    44 The fungus Aspergillus fumigatus effectively degrades plasticized PVC    45  Phanerochaete chrysosporium has been grown on PVC in a mineral salt agar    46  Phanerochaete chrysosporium  Lentinus tigrinus  Aspergillus niger  and Aspergillus sydowii can also effectively degrade PVC    47  Phanerochaete chrysosporium was grown on PVC in a mineral salt agar    46 Acinetobacter has been found to partially degrade low molecular weight polyethylene oligomers    38  When used in combination  Pseudomonas fluorescens and Sphingomonas can degrade over 40  of the weight of plastic bags in less than three months    48  The thermophilic bacterium Brevibacillus borstelensis   strain 707  was isolated from a soil sample and found capable of using low density polyethylene as a sole carbon source when incubated at 50 degrees Celsius  Pre exposure of the plastic to ultraviolet radiation broke chemical bonds and aided biodegradation  the longer the period of UV exposure  the greater the promotion of the degradation    49 Less desirably  hazardous molds have been found aboard space stations  molds that degrade rubber into a digestible form    50 Several species of yeasts  bacteria  algae and lichens have been found growing on synthetic polymer artifacts in museums and at archaeological sites    51 In the plastic polluted waters of the Sargasso Sea  bacteria have been found that consume various types of plastic  however it is unknown to what extent these bacteria effectively clean up poisons rather than simply releasing them into the marine microbial ecosystem  Plastic eating microbes also have been found in landfills    52 Nocardia can degrade PET with an esterase enzyme    53 The fungus Geotrichum candidum  found in Belize  has been found to consume the polycarbonate plastic found in CDs    54    55 Phenol formaldehyde  commonly known as bakelite  is degraded by the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium    56 The futuro house was made of fibreglass reinforced polyesters  polyester polyurethane  and poly  methylmethacrylate   One such house was found to be harmfully degraded by Cyanobacteria and Archaea    57    58 There are differing estimates of how much plastic waste has been produced in the last century  By one estimate  one billion tons of plastic waste has been discarded since the 1950s    59  Others estimate a cumulative human production of 8 3 billion tons of plastic of which 6 3 billion tons is waste  with a recycling rate of only 9     60  Much of this material may persist for centuries or longer  given the demonstrated persistence of structurally similar natural materials such as amber  The presence of plastics  particularly microplastics  within the food chain is increasing  In the 1960s microplastics were observed in the guts of seabirds  and since then have been found in increasing concentrations    61  The long term effects of plastic in the food chain are poorly understood  In 2009  it was estimated that 10  of modern waste was plastic    24  although estimates vary according to region    61  Meanwhile  50 80  of debris in marine areas is plastic    61 Prior to the Montreal Protocol  CFCs were commonly used in the manufacture of polystyrene  and as such the production of polystyrene contributed to the depletion of the ozone layer  Climate change The effect of plastics on global warming is mixed  Plastics are generally made from petroleum  If the plastic is incinerated  it increases carbon emissions  if it is placed in a landfill  it becomes a carbon sink   62  although biodegradable plastics have caused methane emissions    63  Due to the lightness of plastic versus glass or metal  plastic may reduce energy consumption  For example  packaging beverages in PET plastic rather than glass or metal is estimated to save 52  in transportation energy    3 Production of plastics Production of plastics from crude oil requires 62 to 108 MJ Kg  taking into account the average efficiency of US utility stations of 35    Producing silicon and semiconductors for modern electronic equipment is even more energy consuming  230 to 235 MJ Kg of silicon  and about 3 000 MJ Kg of semiconductors    64  This is much higher than the energy needed to produce many other materials  e g  iron  from iron ore  requires 20 25 MJ Kg of energy  glass  from sand  etc   18 35 MJ Kg  steel  from iron  20 50 MJ Kg  paper  from timber  25 50 MJ Kg    65 Incineration of plastics Controlled high temperature incineration  above 850  C for two seconds    66  performed with selective additional heating  breaks down toxic dioxins and furans from burning plastic  and is widely used in municipal solid waste incineration    66  Municipal solid waste incinerators also normally include flue gas treatments to reduce pollutants further    66  This is needed because uncontrolled incineration of plastic produces polychlorinated dibenzo p dioxins  a carcinogen  cancer causing chemical   The problem occurs because the heat content of the waste stream varies    67  Open air burning of plastic occurs at lower temperatures  and normally releases such toxic fumes  Pyrolytic disposal Plastics can be pyrolyzed into hydrocarbon fuels  since plastics include hydrogen and carbon  One kilogram of waste plastic produces roughly a liter of hydrocarbon    68 Recycling Main article  Plastic recycling Thermoplastics can be remelted and reused  and thermoset plastics can be ground up and used as filler  although the purity of the material tends to degrade with each reuse cycle  There are methods by which plastics can be broken down to a feedstock state  The greatest challenge to the recycling of plastics is the difficulty of automating the sorting of plastic wastes  making it labor intensive  Typically  workers sort the plastic by looking at the resin identification code  although common containers like soda bottles can be sorted from memory  Typically  the caps for PETE bottles are made from a different kind of plastic which is not recyclable  which presents additional problems for the sorting process  Other recyclable materials such as metals are easier to process mechanically  However  new processes of mechanical sorting are being developed to increase the capacity and efficiency of plastic recycling  While containers are usually made from a single type and color of plastic  making them relatively easy to sort  a consumer product like a cellular phone may have many small parts consisting of over a dozen different types and colors of plastics  In such cases  the resources it would take to separate the plastics far exceed their value and the item is discarded  However  developments are taking place in the field of active disassembly  which may result in more product components being reused or recycled  Recycling certain types of plastics can be unprofitable as well  For example  polystyrene is rarely recycled because the process is usually not cost effective  These unrecycled wastes are typically disposed of in landfills  incinerated or used to produce electricity at waste to energy plants  An early success in the recycling of plastics is Vinyloop  an industrial process to separate PVC from other materials through dissolution  filtration and separation of contaminants  A solvent is used in a closed loop to elute PVC from the waste  This makes it possible to recycle composite PVC waste  which is normally incinerated or put in a landfill  Vinyloop based recycled PVC s primary energy demand is 46 percent lower than conventionally produced PVC  The global warming potential is 39 percent lower  This is why the use of recycled material leads to a significantly better ecological outcome    69  This process was used after the Olympic Games in London 2012  Parts of temporary Buildings like the Water Polo Arena and the Royal Artillery Barracks were recycled  In this way  the PVC Policy could be fulfilled  which says that no PVC waste should be left after the games had ended    70 In 1988  to assist recycling of disposable items  the Plastic Bottle Institute of the U  S  Society of the Plastics Industry devised a now familiar scheme to mark plastic bottles by plastic type  Under this scheme  a plastic container is marked with a triangle of three    chasing arrows     which encloses a number denoting the plastic type Plastics type marks  the resin identification code   71 Polyethylene terephthalate   PET or PETE High density polyethylene   HDPE Polyvinyl chloride   PVC Low density polyethylene   LDPE Polypropylene   PP Polystyrene   PS Other types of plastic  see list below Representative polymers Molded plastic food replicas on display outside a restaurant in Japan Plastic piping and firestops being installed in Ontario  Certain plastic pipes can be used in some non combustible buildings  provided they are firestopped properly and that the flame spread ratings comply with the local building code  Bakelite Main article  Bakelite The first plastic based on a synthetic polymer was made from phenol and formaldehyde  with the first viable and cheap synthesis methods invented in 1907  by Leo Hendrik Baekeland  a Belgian born American living in New York state  Baekeland was looking for an insulating shellac to coat wires in electric motors and generators  He found that combining phenol  C 6 H 5 OH  and formaldehyde  HCOH  formed a sticky mass and later found that the material could be mixed with wood flour  asbestos  or slate dust to create strong and fire resistant   composite   materials  The new material tended to foam during synthesis  requiring that Baekeland build pressure vessels to force out the bubbles and provide a smooth  uniform product  as he announced in 1909  in a meeting of the American Chemical Society    72  Bakelite was originally used for electrical and mechanical parts  coming into widespread use in consumer goods and jewelry in the 1920s  Bakelite was a purely synthetic material  not derived from living matter  It was also an early thermosetting plastic  Polystyrene Main articles  Polystyrene and PVCStyrene polymerization Unplasticised polystyrene is a rigid  brittle  inexpensive plastic that has been used to make plastic model kits and similar knick knacks  It also is the basis for some of the most popular   foamed   plastics  under the name styrene foam or Styrofoam  Like most other foam plastics  foamed polystyrene can be manufactured in an   open cell   form  in which the foam bubbles are interconnected  as in an absorbent sponge  and   closed cell    in which all the bubbles are distinct  like tiny balloons  as in gas filled foam insulation and flotation devices  In the late 1950s  high impact styrene was introduced  which was not brittle  It finds much current use as the substance of toy figurines and novelties  Polyvinyl chloride Vinylchloride polymerization Polyvinyl chloride   PVC  commonly called   vinyl      73  incorporates chlorine atoms  The C Cl bonds in the backbone are hydrophobic and resist oxidation  and burning   PVC is stiff  strong  heat and weather resistant  properties that recommend its use in devices for plumbing  gutters  house siding  enclosures for computers and other electronics gear  PVC can also be softened with chemical processing  and in this form it is now used for shrink wrap  food packaging  and rain gear  All PVC polymers are degraded by heat and light  When this happens  hydrogen chloride is released into the atmosphere and oxidation of the compound occurs    74  Because hydrogen chloride readily combines with water vapor in the air to form hydrochloric acid    75  polyvinyl chloride is not recommended for long term archival storage of silver  photographic film or paper   mylar is preferable     76 Nylon Main article  Nylon The plastics industry was revolutionized in the 1930s with the announcement of polyamide   PA   far better known by its trade name nylon  Nylon was the first purely synthetic fiber  introduced by Du Pont Corporation at the 1939 World s Fair in New York City  In 1927  Du Pont had begun a secret development project designated Fiber66  under the direction of Harvard chemist Wallace Carothers and chemistry department director Elmer Keiser Bolton  Carothers had been hired to perform pure research  and he worked to understand the new materials  molecular structure and physical properties  He took some of the first steps in the molecular design of the materials  His work led to the discovery of synthetic nylon fiber  which was very strong but also very flexible  The first application was for bristles for toothbrushes  However  Du Pont s real target was silk  particularly silk stockings  Carothers and his team synthesized a number of different polyamides including polyamide 6 6 and 4 6  as well as polyesters    77 General condensation polymerization reaction for nylon It took Du Pont twelve years and US 27 million to refine nylon  and to synthesize and develop the industrial processes for bulk manufacture  With such a major investment  it was no surprise that Du Pont spared little expense to promote nylon after its introduction  creating a public sensation  or   nylon mania    Nylon mania came to an abrupt stop at the end of 1941 when the USA entered World War II  The production capacity that had been built up to produce nylon stockings  or just nylons  for American women was taken over to manufacture vast numbers of parachutes for fliers and paratroopers  After the war ended  Du Pont went back to selling nylon to the public  engaging in another promotional campaign in 1946 that resulted in an even bigger craze  triggering the so called nylon riots  Subsequently  polyamides 6  10  11  and 12 have been developed based on monomers which are ring compounds  e g  caprolactam  Nylon 66 is a material manufactured by condensation polymerization  Nylons still remain important plastics  and not just for use in fabrics  In its bulk form it is very wear resistant  particularly if oil impregnated  and so is used to build gears  plain bearings  valve seats  seals and because of good heat resistance  increasingly for under the hood applications in cars  and other mechanical parts  Poly  methyl methacrylate Main article  Poly  methyl methacrylate Poly  methyl methacrylate     PMMA    also known as acrylic or acrylic glass as well as by the trade names Plexiglas  Acrylite  Lucite  and Perspex among several others  see below   is a transparent thermoplastic often used in sheet form as a lightweight or shatter resistant alternative to glass  The same material can be utilised as a casting resin  in inks and coatings  and has many other uses  Rubber Natural rubber is an elastomer  an elastic hydrocarbon polymer  that originally was derived from latex  a milky colloidal suspension found in specialised vessels in some plants  It is useful directly in this form  indeed  the first appearance of rubber in Europe was cloth waterproofed with unvulcanized latex from Brazil   However  in 1839  Charles Goodyear invented vulcanized rubber  a form of natural rubber heated with sulfur  and a few other chemicals   forming cross links between polymer chains   vulcanization    improving elasticity and durability  In 1851  Nelson Goodyear added fillers to natural rubber materials to form ebonite    30 Synthetic rubber Main article  Synthetic rubber The first fully synthetic rubber was synthesized by Sergei Lebedev in 1910  In World War II  supply blockades of natural rubber from South East Asia caused a boom in development of synthetic rubber  notably styrene butadiene rubber  In 1941  annual production of synthetic rubber in the U  S  was only 231 tonnes which increased to 840 000 tonnes in 1945  In the space race and nuclear arms race  Caltech researchers experimented with using synthetic rubbers for solid fuel for rockets  Ultimately  all large military rockets and missiles would use synthetic rubber based solid fuels  and they would also play a significant part in the civilian space effort  See also Plastics engineering Nurdle Self healing plastic Plasticulture Plastic recycling Plastic film Plastics extrusion Molding  process

aspirin therapy  Understand the benefits and risks", "body": "Daily aspirin therapy  Understand the benefits and risks Daily aspirin therapy can be a lifesaving option  but it s not for everyone  Get the facts before considering a daily aspirin  By Mayo Clinic Staff Daily aspirin therapy may lower your risk of heart attack  but daily aspirin therapy isn t for everyone  Is it right for you If you ve had a heart attack or stroke  your doctor will likely recommend you take a daily aspirin unless you have a serious allergy or history of bleeding  If you have a high risk of having a first heart attack  your doctor will likely recommend aspirin after weighing the risks and benefits  You shouldn t start daily aspirin therapy on your own  however  While taking an occasional aspirin or two is safe for most adults to use for headaches  body aches or fever  daily use of aspirin can have serious side effects  including internal bleeding  How can aspirin prevent a heart attack Aspirin interferes with your blood s clotting action  When you bleed  your blood s clotting cells  called platelets  build up at the site of your wound  The platelets help form a plug that seals the opening in your blood vessel to stop bleeding  But this clotting can also happen within the vessels that supply your heart with blood  If your blood vessels are already narrowed from atherosclerosis   the buildup of fatty deposits in your arteries   a fatty deposit in your vessel lining can burst  Then  a blood clot can quickly form and block the artery  This prevents blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack  Aspirin therapy reduces the clumping action of platelets   possibly preventing a heart attack  Should you take a daily aspirin Talk with your doctor about whether daily aspirin therapy might help you prevent a heart attack  Your doctor may suggest daily aspirin therapy if You ve already had a heart attack or stroke  You haven t had a heart attack  but you have had a stent placed in a coronary artery  you have had coronary bypass surgery  or you have chest pain due to coronary artery disease  angina   You ve never had a heart attack  but you re at high risk of having one  You have diabetes and at least one other heart disease risk factor   such as smoking or high blood pressure   and you re a man older than 50 or a woman older than 60  The use of aspirin to prevent heart attacks in people with diabetes but no other risk factor is controversial  The U  S  Preventive Services Task Force recommends daily aspirin therapy if you re age 50 to 59  you re not at increased bleeding risk  and you have an increased risk of heart attack or stroke of 10 percent or greater over the next 10 years  If you re age 60 to 69  you aren t at increased bleeding risk  and you have a high risk of heart attack or stroke of 10 percent or greater over the next 10 years  talk to your doctor about daily aspirin therapy  More research is needed to determine the benefits and risks of daily aspirin use in adults younger than age 50 and older than age 70 before a recommendation can be made for or against aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer for these age groups  Although aspirin has been recommended in the past for certain groups of people without a history of heart attack  there s some disagreement among experts about whether the benefits of aspirin outweigh its potential risks  The Food and Drug Administration doesn t recommend aspirin therapy for the prevention of heart attacks in people who haven t already had a heart attack  stroke or another cardiovascular condition  Guidelines are varied between organizations  but they re evolving as more research is done  The benefits of daily aspirin therapy don t outweigh the risk of bleeding in people with a low risk of heart attacks  The higher your risk of heart attack  the more likely it is that the benefits of daily aspirin outweigh the risk of bleeding  The bottom line is that before taking a daily aspirin you should have a discussion with your doctor  Should you avoid daily aspirin therapy if you have another health condition Before starting daily aspirin therapy under the advice of your doctor  you should let him or her know if you have a health condition that could increase your risk of bleeding or other complications  These conditions include A bleeding or clotting disorder  bleeding easily Aspirin allergy  which can include asthma caused by aspirin Bleeding stomach ulcers What s the best dose of aspirin to take Your doctor will discuss what dose is right for you  Very low doses of aspirin   such as 75 to 150 milligrams  mg   but most commonly 81 mg   can be effective  Your doctor will usually prescribe a daily dose anywhere from 75 mg   the amount in an adult low dose aspirin   to 325 mg  a regular strength tablet   If you have had a heart attack or have had a heart stent placed  it s very important to take aspirin and any other blood thinning medications exactly as recommended  What happens if you stop taking aspirin every day You might be surprised to learn that stopping daily aspirin therapy can have a rebound effect that may increase your risk of heart attack  If you have had a heart attack or a stent placed in one or more of your heart arteries  stopping daily aspirin therapy can lead to a life threatening heart attack  If you have been taking daily aspirin therapy and want to stop  it s important to talk to your doctor before making any changes  Suddenly stopping daily aspirin therapy could have a rebound effect that may trigger a blood clot  Can you take aspirin if you regularly take ibuprofen or another nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug  NSAID  for another condition Both aspirin and nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medications  NSAIDs   such as ibuprofen  Motrin IB  Advil  others  and naproxen sodium  Aleve   reduce the clotting action of blood platelets  Regular use of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medications can increase your bleeding risk  Some NSAIDs can increase the risk of heart attacks on their own  Additionally  some NSAIDs can adversely interact with aspirin  increasing the risk of bleeding even more  If you need only a single dose of ibuprofen  take it two hours after the aspirin  If you need to take ibuprofen or other NSAIDs more often  talk to your doctor about medication alternatives that won t interfere with daily aspirin therapy  What are the possible side effects of daily aspirin therapy Side effects and complications of taking aspirin include Stroke caused by a burst blood vessel  While daily aspirin can help prevent a clot related stroke  it may increase your risk of a bleeding stroke  hemorrhagic stroke   Gastrointestinal bleeding  Daily aspirin use increases your risk of developing a stomach ulcer  And  if you have a bleeding ulcer or bleeding anywhere else in your gastrointestinal tract  taking aspirin will cause it to bleed more  perhaps to a life threatening extent  Allergic reaction  If you re allergic to aspirin  taking any amount of aspirin can trigger a serious allergic reaction  If you re taking aspirin and need a surgical procedure or dental work  be sure to tell the surgeon or dentist that you take daily aspirin and how much  Otherwise you risk excessive bleeding during surgery  Don t stop taking aspirin without talking to your doctor  however  People who regularly take aspirin and drink alcohol can have an increased risk of stomach bleeding  Talk to your doctor about how much alcohol is safe to drink  If you choose to drink alcohol  do so in moderation  For healthy adults  that means up to one drink a day for women of all ages and men older than age 65  and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger  What are possible drug interactions with daily aspirin therapy If you re already taking an anticoagulant  such as warfarin  Coumadin  Jantoven   apixaban  Eliquis   dabigatran  Pradaxa  or rivaroxaban  Xarelto  for another condition  combining it with aspirin may greatly increase the risk of major bleeding complications  However  there may be some conditions for which combining a low dose of aspirin with warfarin or another anticoagulant is appropriate  But  this therapy always needs to be carefully discussed with your doctor  Other medications and herbal supplements also may increase your risk of bleeding  Medications that can interact with aspirin include Heparin Ibuprofen  Advil  Motrin IB  others   when taken regularly Corticosteroids Clopidogrel  Plavix Some antidepressants  clomipramine  paroxetine  others Taking some dietary supplements can also increase your bleeding risk  These include Bilberry Capsaicin Cat s claw Danshen Evening primrose oil Ginkgo Kava Ma Huang Omega 3 fatty acids  fish oil If you take daily aspirin  is it still safe to take an aspirin during a heart attack If you think you re having a heart attack  the most important thing for you to do is call 911 or emergency medical services  Don t delay calling for help  Aspirin alone won t save your life if you re having a heart attack  The operator may advise you to chew an aspirin  but will first ask questions to make sure you re not allergic to aspirin or you don t have any other health conditions that would make taking an aspirin during a heart attack too risky  It s OK to chew an aspirin if your doctor has previously told you to do so if you think you re having a heart attack   but call 911 or emergency medical services first  Should you take a coated aspirin Enteric coated aspirin is designed to pass through your stomach and not disintegrate until it reaches your small intestine  It may be gentler on the stomach and may be appropriate for some people who take a daily aspirin  especially in those with a history of gastritis or ulcers  However  some researchers think there s no evidence that taking an enteric coated aspirin decreases your chance of developing gastrointestinal bleeding  In addition  some research has found that coated aspirin may not be as effective as plain aspirin when taken at the time of a possible heart attack  Talk to your doctor if you re concerned about ways to decrease your bleeding risk  Share Tweet Feb  21  2018References See more In depth Products and Services Book  The Mayo Clinic Diet Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program Book  Mayo Clinic Healthy Heart
